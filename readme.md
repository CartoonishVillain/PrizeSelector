Does all the work of picking your prizes for you, so long as you give it the right data.

What is the right data however?

prizes.txt: Contains a list of prizes, separated by new lines. Example:

Prize1
Prize2
Prize3

data.csv: A file that contains potential winners and their entries.

example:

player,entries
player1,6.2
player2,2.4
player3,9.1

With the correct data provided, it will pick randomly from the available pool of players to hand prizes out to until either there are no more prizes to give, or players to give them to.
